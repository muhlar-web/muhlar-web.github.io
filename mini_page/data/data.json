The findings are formally documented and organized into dedicated case study sections to ensure clarity and accessibility. Each section outlines the objectives and outcomes of individual studies, offering a structured and transparent overview of the research process. The goal is to provide meaningful insights for peers, collaborators, and anyone with an interest in the subject matter. A central focus of the work is the <strong>Methodology for Modeling and Simulation of Underactuated Dynamic Systems</strong>. One of the most widely adopted and computationally efficient approaches for analytically modeling such systems is the use of <strong>Lagrangeâ€™s equations of the second kind</strong>."
